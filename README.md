# S.A.L.T
A Structured Application Programming Interface Language for TypeScript APIs

## Purpose
S.A.L.T is an internal/embedded Domain Specific Language for expressing type-safe web APIs written in TypeScript through the OpenAPI specification.

The key features of SALT is an entirely type-safe, immutable API to express an OpenAPI specification in TypeScript.

In addition, schema generators and openapi generation will be available on demand.

Utilizing these powerful features in tandem, one can construct a complete type-safe API without using external code generation libraries that lock you into a specific architecture. This allows for creating flexible APIs knowing fully well that the generated schemas and validation logic will remain as close as possible to your API specification.
